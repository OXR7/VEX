# VEX
This is a bot that tracks smart wallets and sends their buys in a channel. It has a basic feature that sends basic token info when a CA is sent. When the PNL button is clicked on the replied message, it will show the progress of the coin since it was called out. The bot will need to be tweaked if someone wants to use it for their own server, some channel IDs and a few other things will need to be changed.
